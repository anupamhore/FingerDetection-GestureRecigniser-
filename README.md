Trained a deep neural network to detect finger counting. It can be used as gesture recognizer.

This model used YoloV5 for classification and LabelImg for annotation tool. 

STEPS:
=======
1. Download the YoloV5 model.
2. Download the Annotation LabelImg. Use your own image datasets and create the annotation with this exe.
3. Use the Sign Language Generation Model to create the model. It is created using Google Colab.
4. Put it in the YoloV5 model directory
5. Use the VideoCapture python script to run from command line
